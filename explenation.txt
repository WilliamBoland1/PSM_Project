Split the Time Interval into Two Routes:

Route 1: The first half of the total time interval in the data.
Route 2: The second half of the total time interval in the data.
Generate Two Sets of Plots for Each Route:

Plot 1 for each route: "Propulsion Power in Separate Engines"
This plot should show the propulsion power of the Port and Starboard engines separately over time.
Plot 2 for each route: "Total Propulsion Power"
This plot should show the total propulsion power (Port + Starboard) over time.
In total, there will be four plots:

Route 1:
Plot 1: Propulsion power in separate engines (Port and Starboard)
Plot 2: Total propulsion power
Route 2:
Plot 1: Propulsion power in separate engines (Port and Starboard)
Plot 2: Total propulsion power

Explanation of the Code
Calculate Midpoint:

midpoint_time is determined by taking the average between the start and end timestamps.
Split Data into Routes:

df_route_1 contains rows from the beginning up to (but not including) midpoint_time.
df_route_2 contains rows from midpoint_time onward.
Plotting:

For each route, we create two plots:
The first plot shows Port_motor_power and Starboard_motor_power on the same plot to represent the power of each motor separately.
The second plot shows total_propulsion_power, the sum of both motors' power.
This approach will create four plots, with each route represented separately, as per the task requirements. Let me know if you have any questions!
